        <h3>13. Yoad Discord Bot Data Practices</h3>
        <p>
          When you interact with "Yoad," our Discord bot, additional data collection and processing occurs 
          specific to the bot's functionality. This section details what data Yoad collects, how it's used, 
          and your rights regarding this data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Collected by Yoad:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Message Content:</strong> All messages sent in channels where Yoad is present are 
          accessible to the bot for command processing and AI response generation. Message content is 
          logged in the bot operator's terminal for debugging and monitoring purposes.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Discord Identifiers:</strong> User IDs, usernames, discriminators, server/guild IDs, 
          channel IDs, and message IDs are collected to identify interactions and provide bot services.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Voice Channel Audio:</strong> When "hearing mode" is enabled, Yoad receives voice 
          channel audio streams in real-time. This audio is played back through the bot operator's system 
          but is NOT permanently recorded or stored to disk.</li>
          
          <li><strong>AI Conversation History:</strong> Interactions with YoadGPT and ChatGPT features are 
          stored to maintain conversation context and improve AI model performance. These conversations 
          include your prompts and the AI's responses.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Interaction Metadata:</strong> Timestamps, command usage, reaction additions, and 
          other bot interaction data are logged for analytics and debugging.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Image Previews:</strong> When you send image attachments in channels where Yoad is 
          present, these images may be previewed in the bot operator's terminal interface for monitoring 
          purposes. Images are not permanently stored by the bot.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Error Logs:</strong> Technical errors, exceptions, and bot performance data are 
          logged to help identify and fix issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>How Yoad Data is Used:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service Provision:</strong> To execute commands, play audio, generate AI responses, 
          and provide bot functionality</li>
          
          <li><strong>AI Training & Improvement:</strong> Conversation history with Yoad's AI features may 
          be used to fine-tune and improve OpenAI models and the bot's response quality</li>
          
          <li><strong>Debugging & Monitoring:</strong> Message logs and error reports help bot operators 
          identify issues, fix bugs, and maintain bot stability</li>
          
          <li><strong>Feature Development:</strong> Usage patterns and interaction data inform decisions 
          about new features and improvements</li>
          
          <li><strong>Security & Abuse Prevention:</strong> Logs help identify misuse, spam, or attempts 
          to exploit the bot</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Retention for Yoad:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Message Logs:</strong> Terminal logs are retained during active bot sessions and may 
          be saved to log files at the bot operator's discretion. These logs may be retained indefinitely 
          for debugging purposes.</li>
          
          <li><strong>AI Conversation History:</strong> Stored in memory during bot runtime and may be 
          persisted to maintain conversation context across sessions. May be retained indefinitely for 
          AI training purposes.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Voice Audio:</strong> Real-time only - not stored or recorded permanently</li>
          
          <li><strong>Error Logs:</strong> Retained for debugging purposes, typically for 30-90 days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Sharing:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> AI prompts and responses are processed by OpenAI's API. OpenAI's 
          privacy policy and data practices apply to this data. As of our last update, OpenAI does not 
          use API data for training unless you explicitly opt in.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Discord:</strong> Yoad operates through Discord's platform and must comply with 
          Discord's API Terms. Discord has access to all bot interactions as part of their platform.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Bot Operators:</strong> NGP team members who operate Yoad can see message logs, 
          user interactions, and bot activity through the terminal interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Your Rights Regarding Yoad Data:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Removal from Servers:</strong> Server administrators can remove Yoad from their server 
          at any time, which prevents further data collection from that server</li>
          
          <li><strong>Data Deletion Requests:</strong> You may request deletion of your AI conversation 
          history or other Yoad-related data by contacting us. Note that some terminal logs may have been 
          archived and cannot be fully deleted.</li>
          
          <li><strong>Opt-Out of AI Features:</strong> Server administrators can restrict which channels 
          Yoad can access, limiting data collection to specific channels</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Important Considerations:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Server administrators are responsible for informing their members about Yoad's presence and 
          data practices</li>
          
          <li>By using Discord servers where Yoad is present, you acknowledge that the bot may log your 
          messages and interactions</li>
          
          <li>Yoad's "Chaos Mode" feature may cause the bot to randomly interact with your messages 
          (replies, reactions) without being directly invoked</li>
          
          <li>Voice channel audio in "hearing mode" is transmitted in real-time to bot operators but is 
          not recorded or stored permanently</li>
          
          <li>Avoid sharing sensitive personal information in channels where Yoad is present, as message 
          content may be logged</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For questions specific to Yoad's data practices, to request data deletion, or to report concerns, 
          please contact us through our Discord server or contact page.
